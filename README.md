glbind
======
glbind is a single file OpenGL API loader. It includes a full implementation of the OpenGL headers (auto-generated
from the OpenGL spec) so there's no need for the offical headers or SDK. Unlike the official headers, the
platform-specific sections are all contained within the same file.
